### About data ðŸ“Š

The data directory contains the artifacts used for the [IPIP](https://ipip.ori.org/) used by this library, in the short version with **120** items and the long version with **300** items.

If you are thinking of using this library in your project, you must follow the pattern of the question and answer files proposed here (ANSEWER LINK).

The translations of the questions are in the **translation** box, as the translations happen, we will attach them to this directory. If you want to send a translation that is not in the repository, feel free to contribute with us following the *json file pattern*.

If you have any questions, please send us an email to: (**e at neural.io**) or create an issue reporting the question of the problem in the repository of this project (https://github.com/neural7/five-factor-e/issues).


Thanks!
