</p>

This project assesses a person's üó£ personality based on an inventory of questions. The project uses the **Big Five** theory using the [IPIP-NEO-300](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo300.htm) model created by **Lewis R. Goldberg** and [IPIP-NEO-120](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm) the shorter version developed by Professor **Dr. John A. Johnson**, this is a free representation of the [NEO PI-R‚Ñ¢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory).

üëâ *"The IPIP-NEO is not identical to the original NEO PI-R, but in my opinion it is close enough to serve as a good substitute. More and more people are beginning to use it in published research, so its acceptance is growing."* - Dr. Johnson

The main idea of the project is to facilitate the use of **Python** developers who want to use **IPIP-NEO** in their projects. *The project is also done in pure Python, it doesn't have any dependencies on other libraries*.

üëâ *"That is wonderful, ...! Thank you for developing the Python version of the IPIP-NEO and making it publicly available. It looks like a great resource."* - Dr. Johnson

Note üö©: *The project is based on the work of **Dhiru Kholia**, and is an adaptation of [NeuroQuest](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi) for a version that can be reused in other projects of the company.*

### Synopsis üåê

A little theory, The Big Five or Five Factor is made up of **5** great human personalities also known as the üåä **O.C.E.A.N**. Are they:

 * **O**penness
 * **C**onscientiousness
 * **E**xtraversion
 * **A**greeableness
 * **N**euroticism

To compose each great personality there are **6** traits or facets, totaling **30** traits. The user must answer a questionnaire of **120** or **300** single choice questions with **5** options:

* Very Inaccurate
* Moderately Inaccurate
* Neither Accurate Nor Inaccurate
* Moderately Accurate
* Very Accurate

For more information to demystify the Big Five, please see the article: [Measuring the Big Five Personality Domains](https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html).

User-selected answers follow the position:

| Option                          | Array       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Very Inaccurate                 | 1           |
| Moderately Inaccurate           | 2           |
| Neither Accurate Nor Inaccurate | 3           |
| Moderately Accurate             | 4           |
| Very Accurate                   | 5           |

Note üö©: Some answers have the order of the [score reversed](https://ipip.ori.org/newScoringInstructions.htm), the algorithm treats the questions with the score inverted by (*question_id*).

### Releases üéà

News about each version please look here:

  * [Releases](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/RELEASES.md)

### Installation üöÄ

From **PyPI**:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade five-factor-e
```

From source:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e.git
$ cd five-factor-e
$ python3 -m pip install .
```

### How to use üî•

The construtor requires the questions model, whether it is the **300** model or short model with **120** questions. It also has the version to do simulations with the questions that are [reversed](https://ipip.ori.org/newScoringInstructions.htm). For this, you must turn the **test** variable from false to true, for more details on reverse scoring tests see section [Experiments with reverse scoring questions](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/README.md).

| Parameters    | Type      | Description                                                       |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| question      | int       | Question type, 120 or 300.                                        |
| test          | boolean   | Used to simulate reverse scoring questions, only used for studies.|

Example:

```python
from ipipneo import IpipNeo

ipip = IpipNeo(question=120)
```

The **120** item version is a short version of the inventory, but you can use the full **300** item version. Example:

```python
from ipipneo import IpipNeo

ipip = IpipNeo(question=300)
```

The answers must be in a *standardized json*, you can insert this template in the [data](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json) folder of the project. This dictionary contains random answers, used for testing purposes only. As an example, you can load the file with the **120** test responses:

```python
import json, urllib.request

data = urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuroQuestAi"\
   "/five-factor-e/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json").read()

answers120 = json.loads(data)
```

For the long inventory version with **300** items.

```python
import json, urllib.request

data = urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuroQuestAi"\
   "/five-factor-e/main/data/IPIP-NEO/300/answers.json").read()

answers300 = json.loads(data)
```

#### Compute the data üèÅ

The **compute** method is used to evaluate the answers, see the table below with the parameters:

| Parameters    | Type      | Description                                               |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| sex           | string    | The sex of the individual (M or F).                       |
| age           | int       | The age of the individual (between 18 and 100 years old). |
| answers       | dict      | Standardized dictionary with answers.                     |
| compare       | boolean   | If true, it shows the user's answers and reverse score.   |

Calculate the Big Five for a **40-year-old man**:

```python
IpipNeo(question=120).compute(sex="M", age=40, answers=answers120)
```

For the long version of the inventory just change the parameters *question* to **300**.

```python
IpipNeo(question=300).compute(sex="M", age=40, answers=answers300)
```

Calculating the Big Five for a **25-year-old woman**:

```python
IpipNeo(question=120).compute(sex="F", age=25, answers=answers120)
```

### Tests üèó

For the tests it is necessary to download the repository. To run the unit tests use the command below:

```shell
$ ./run-test
```

#### Using inventory for testing üìö

If you want to make an assessment by answering the inventory of questions, just run:

```shell
$ ipipneo-quiz
```

In this program you take an assessment for the short version with **120** items as well as the **300** item version, just follow the program's instructions. It is possible to see the **basic graphs** of your **Big-Five** via terminal, if you want to see the graphs at the end of the questionnaires you need to run the installation command:

```shell
$ pip install five-factor-e[quiz]
```

Example output with graphics:

*The complete result is saved in the run folder in json format*.

### About data üìä

Inside the data [data](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/) directory, there are examples of questions and answers. The most important is the response data entry which must follow the pattern of this [file](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json). Example:

```json
{
   "answers":[
      {
         "id_question":50,
         "id_select":5
      },
      {
         "id_question":51,
         "id_select":2
      }
   ]
}
```

The id question field refers to the question in this [file](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/questions.json).
Obviously if you want you can change the translation of the question, *but don't change the ID of the question*.

Note üö©:
  * *The order of answers does not affect the result;*
  * *You can rephrase the questions to your need, but don't change the question IDs, they are used by the algorithm.*
