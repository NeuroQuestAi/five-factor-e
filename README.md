</p>

This project assesses a person's üó£ personality based on an inventory of questions. The project uses the Big Five theory using the [IPIP-NEO-120](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm) and [IPIP-NEO-300](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo300.htm) model developed by Professor **Dr. John A. Johnson**, this is free representation of [NEO PI-R‚Ñ¢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory).

*"The IPIP-NEO is not identical to the original NEO PI-R, but in my opinion it is close enough to serve as a good substitute. More and more people are beginning to use it in published research, so its acceptance is growing."* - Dr. Johnson

*"That is wonderful, ...! Thank you for developing the Python version of the IPIP-NEO and making it publicly available. It looks like a great resource."* - Dr. Johnson

The main idea of the project is to facilitate the use of **Python** developers who want to use **IPIP-NEO** in their projects. *The project is also done in pure Python, it doesn't have any dependencies on other libraries*.

Note: *The project is based on the work of **Dhiru Kholia**, and is an adaptation of [Neural7](https://github.com/neural7) for a version that can be reused in other projects of the company.*

### Synopsis üåê

A little theory, the The Big Five or Five Factor is made up of **5** great human personalities also known as the *O.C.E.A.N*. Are they:

 * **O**penness
 * **C**onscientiousness
 * **E**xtraversion
 * **A**greeableness
 * **N**euroticism

To compose each great personality there are **6** traits or facets, totaling **30** traits. The user must answer a questionnaire of 120 or 300 single choice questions with **5** options:

* Very Inaccurate
* Moderately Inaccurate
* Neither Accurate Nor Inaccurate
* Moderately Accurate
* Very Accurate

For more information to demystify the Big Five, please see the article: [Measuring the Big Five Personality Domains](https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html)

Notes: *User-selected answers follow the position:*

| Option                          | Array       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Very Inaccurate                 | 1           |
| Moderately Inaccurate           | 2           |
| Neither Accurate Nor Inaccurate | 3           |
| Moderately Accurate             | 4           |
| Very Accurate                   | 5           |

### Installation üöÄ

The simplest way is to use **PIP**, like the command:

```shell
$ pip install five-factor-e
```

### How to use üî•

The answers must be in a standardized *json*, you can enter this template in the project folder [data](https://github.com/neural7/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json). Valid parameters for compute method:

| Parameters    | Type      | Description                                             |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| sex           | string    | Gender of the individual (M or F).                      |
| age           | int       | The age of the individual.                              |
| answers       | dict      | Standardized dictionary with answers.                   |
| compare       | boolean   | If true, it shows the user's answers and reverse score. |

To calculate the Big Five use the code snippet below:

```python
from ipipneo import IpipNeo

IpipNeo(question=120).compute(sex=<>, age=<>, answers=JSON_STANDARD)
```

This dictionary contains random answers, used for testing purposes only. As an example you can load the json project to test:

```python
import json, urllib.request

data = urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neural7"\
   "/five-factor-e/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json").read()

answers = json.loads(data)
```

Calculate the Big Five for a 40-year-old man:

```python
IpipNeo(question=120).compute(sex="M", age=40, answers=answers)
```

For a 25 year old woman:

```python
IpipNeo(question=120).compute(sex="F", age=25, answers=answers)
```

### Tests üèó

For the tests it is necessary to download the repository. To run the unit tests use the command below:

```shell
$ ./run-test
```

If you want to make an assessment by answering the inventory of questions, just run:

```shell
$ python3 quiz.py
```

### About data üìä

Inside the data [data](https://github.com/neural7/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/) directory, there are examples of questions and answers. The most important is the response data entry which must follow the pattern of this [file](https://github.com/neural7/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/answers.json). Example:

```json
{
   "answers":[
      {
         "id_question":50,
         "id_select":5
      },
      {
         "id_question":51,
         "id_select":2
      }
   ]
}
```

The id question field refers to the question in this [file](https://github.com/neural7/five-factor-e/blob/main/data/IPIP-NEO/120/questions.json).
Obviously if you want you can change the translation of the question, *but don't change the ID of the question*.

Notes:
  * *The order of answers does not affect the result;*
  * *You can rephrase the questions to your need, but don't change the question IDs, they are used by the algorithm.*
