This project assesses a person's :busts_in_silhouette: personality based on an inventory of questions. The project uses the Big Five theory using the [IPIP-NEO-120](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm) and [IPIP-NEO-300](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo300.htm) model developed by Professor Dr. John A. Johnson, this is free version of [NEO PI-R‚Ñ¢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory).

*"The IPIP-NEO is not identical to the original NEO PI-R, but in my opinion it is close enough to serve as a good substitute. More and more people are beginning to use it in published research, so its acceptance is growing."* - Dr. Johnson
